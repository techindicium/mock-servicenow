# Refactoring Spec: {{ spec_title }}

<!-- Refactoring spec within the {{ module_name }} charter.
     Extends the Live Spec format with current-state/target-state analysis and migration path.
     Parent Charter: .context-index/specs/features/{{ module_name }}/charter.md -->

## Current State

<!-- Describe the code as it exists today. Be specific about files, patterns, and problems. -->

### Structure

<!-- Key files and their roles in the current implementation. -->

| File | Role | Lines | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Problems

<!-- What is wrong with the current state. Be precise: performance numbers, complexity metrics,
     bug frequency, developer friction. Avoid vague complaints. -->

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

### Dependencies

<!-- What other code depends on the current implementation. These are your migration constraints. -->

- ...

## Target State

<!-- Describe what the code should look like after refactoring. -->

### Structure

<!-- Key files and their roles in the target implementation. -->

| File | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Improvements

<!-- How the target state addresses each problem listed in Current State. -->

3. ...

## Changes Catalog

<!-- OpenSpec-style enumeration of what this refactor changes, classified by
     the kind of change. Additive to Migration Path: the catalog answers
     "what's different" at a glance; the path answers "how do we get there safely". -->

### ADDED

<!-- New files, exports, behaviors, or contracts introduced by this refactor.
     List each item with a one-line rationale. Omit subsection if empty. -->

- ...

### MODIFIED

<!-- Existing files, exports, behaviors, or contracts whose meaning changes.
     Be precise about what changed and why. Omit subsection if empty. -->

- ...

### REMOVED

<!-- Files, exports, or behaviors deleted by this refactor. Each removal must
     have a deprecation path or compatibility shim noted in Migration Path.
     Omit subsection if empty. -->

- ...

### RENAMED

<!-- Identifier or path renames. Format: `old → new` with a one-line rationale.
     Omit subsection if empty. -->

- ...

## Migration Path

<!-- Step-by-step plan for getting from current to target state.
     Each step must leave the system in a working state (all tests pass).
     This is the critical section: a bad migration path causes regressions. -->

### Step 1: {{ step_title }}

- **What:** ...
- **Why first:** ...
- **Risk:** ...
- **Verification:** Tests that must pass after this step

### Step 2: {{ step_title }}

- **What:** ...
- **Why next:** ...
- **Risk:** ...
- **Verification:** ...

<!-- Add more steps as needed. Prefer many small steps over few large ones. -->

## Invariants

<!-- Properties that must remain true throughout the entire migration.
     Every migration step must preserve these. They are your safety net. -->

- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass at every step
- [ ] Public API contracts do not change (unless the spec explicitly permits it)
- [ ] No data loss or corruption during migration
- [ ] ...

## Behavioral Contract

<!-- Same as a standard Live Spec: define the target behavior. -->

### Behaviors

<!-- Each behavior carries a spec-scoped ID of the form BEH-<n>. Allocate the next
     ID above the highest ever used in this spec (live or retired); never reuse a
     number. When a behavior is withdrawn, move its ID into the comment below. -->

<!-- retired-behavior-ids: (none) -->

- **BEH-1** — **When** ... **then** ...
- **BEH-2** — **When** ... **then** ...

### Error Cases

| Condition | Expected Behavior | Error Code |

## System Constitution Reference

- **Principle:** "{{ principle_text }}" — Applies because ...

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All current tests pass without modification (unless explicitly scoped for change)
- [ ] New tests cover the refactored code paths
- [ ] Problems listed in Current State are resolved
- [ ] All quality gates pass (tests, lint, typecheck)
- [ ] No constitutional violations introduced
